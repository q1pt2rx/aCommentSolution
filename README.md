# aCommentSolution
A personal compendium of commenting practices which makes code clean for reading, and searching easier.



I believe that commenting is not only a tool but an art that can be used for more than just remembering what the purpose of code is.

if comments are done just right, reading the actual logic can be entertaining and engaging which serves to only make the 
learning process smoother and less tiresome.

Lastly, by using special commenting symbols, code can be searched more easily which makes finding that particular bit of logic just
that much quicker and less frustrating.



Currently there are examples for how to use my commenting practices for the C++ programming language; this list will update as
I learn more languages and/or others collaborate with their knowledge.
